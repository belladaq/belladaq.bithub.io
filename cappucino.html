                Made in 1902, the intricate, expensive espresso machine was brought over from Italy in 1927 as the starting point for the cafe. 
                The original owner of the cafe spent his life savings of $1,000 to bring the machine over to America after the cappuccino became popular in Italy at the beginning of the 20th century. 
                Made of copper and chrome, the machine is topped with an angel and the bottom surrounded by dragons. 
                The machine was the first of its kind and still remains on display in the cafe after its retirement from use in the 90s among a number of other historical paintings and <a href="artifact.html">artifacts</a>.

                A cappuccino calls for equal parts espresso, foam, and steamed milk. Compared to a latte, a classic cappuccino retains these three distinct layers. 
                The original owner of <a href="homepage.html">Caffe Reggio</a>, Domenico Parisi, claimed that his machine was a beast that only he could wrangle. 
                He preferred to close shop when he was sick rather than allow someone else to attempt to use the intricate machine.
