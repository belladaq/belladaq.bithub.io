                Located on the corner of West 3rd and MacDougal, Caffe Reggio is one of the oldest cafes in all of New York City and one of the first American cafes to offer the cappuccino. 
                It was opened in 1927 by Domenico Parisi, an Italian immigrant who left his employment as a barber to bring Italian coffee to America. 
                The cafe is open from the morning until past midnight, closing at 4am on weekends. 
                At any given time, the cafe is populated with the most interesting people of the West Village having meetings, reading, journaling,  drawing, or working. 
                On the food menu, they offer a range of pastries, paninis, salads and pasta. 
                Apart from their famous cappuccino, their drink menu offers other espresso drinks, in addition to teas and alcoholic beverages such as mojitos, sangria, espresso martinis, and more.
